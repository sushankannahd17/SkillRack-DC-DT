/*
In a garden, there are N trees from left to right. The height of each tree is passed as input to the program. The gardener wants to
cut down T trees completely from left to right, but if he cuts a tree of height H, then he must plant certain number of trees based
on the following conditions.
- If H is odd, then he must plant H trees of Height ranging from 1 to H on the rightmost end.
- If H is even, the he must plant H/2 trees of height ranging from H/2 to 1 on the rightmost end.
The value of T is also passed as the input to the program. The program must print the number of trees remaaining in the garden
after cutting down T trees as output.
